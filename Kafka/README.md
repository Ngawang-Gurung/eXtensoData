# Apache Kafka and ZooKeeper in Windows

## Introduction

**Apache Kafka** is a distributed platform for real-time data streaming and processing whereas **ZooKeeper** is a centralized service for configuration management and synchronization in distributed systems.

## ZooKeeper Installation

1. Download ZooKeeper from the [official releases page](https://zookeeper.apache.org/releases.html) to C Directory.
2. Go to your ZooKeeper config directory. For example: `C:\zookeeper-3.9.2\conf`
3. Rename the file `zoo_sample.cfg` to `zoo.cfg`
4. Open `zoo.cfg` in any text editor, and edit the line:
   ```plaintext
   dataDir=/tmp/zookeeper
   ```
   to:
   ```plaintext
   dataDir=C:/zookeeper-3.9.2/data
   ```

## Kafka Installation

1. Download Kafka from the [official downloads page](https://kafka.apache.org/downloads.html).
2. Go to your Kafka config directory. For example: `C:\kafka_2.13-3.7.0\config`
3. Find the file `server.properties` and edit the line:
   ```plaintext
   log.dirs=/tmp/kafka-logs
   ```
   to:
   ```plaintext
   log.dirs=C:/kafka_2.13-3.7.0/kafka-logs
   ```
4. If your ZooKeeper is running on a different machine or cluster, edit the line:
   ```plaintext
   zookeeper.connect=localhost:2181
   ```
   to your custom IP and port.

   Note: Your Kafka will run on the default port `9092` and connect to ZooKeeperâ€™s default port `2181`.

## Environment Variables and Path Configuration

### User Variables

Add the following user variable:
- `ZOOKEEPER_HOME = C:\zookeeper-3.9.2`

### Path

Add the following paths to the system `Path` variable:
- `%ZOOKEEPER_HOME%\bin`
- `C:\kafka_2.13-3.7.0\bin\windows`

## Running ZooKeeper

Open a command prompt and enter:
```cmd
zkserver
```

## Running a Kafka Server

**Important:** Ensure that your ZooKeeper instance is up and running before starting the Kafka server.

Run the following command in a command prompt:
```cmd
kafka-server-start.bat C:\kafka_2.13-3.7.0\config\server.properties
```
## Dependencies

Install the necessary dependencies:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
